# Afri-Fest React Starter

This is a Vite + React setup with your site split into clean components and vanilla CSS files.

## Quick Start

```bash
# In VS Code terminal
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Where to put your assets

Place your files under `public/` so you can reference them like `/assets/...` and `/video/...`:

- `public/assets/images/Afri-fest-logo-black.png`
- `public/assets/images/*.jpg`
- `public/video/afrivid.mp4`
- `public/video/afrimobillll.mp4`

## Notes

- Swiper is used via React components (`swiper/react`). Already configured in `Gallery.jsx` and `Merch.jsx`.
- Sections are split into: Navbar, Hero, About, Gallery, Merch, Events, Parallax, MapSection, Sponsors, Partners, Footer.
- All vanilla CSS is in `src/styles/`.
